## Executive Summary
This report analyzes Bose QuietComfort headphones’ production management strategies, emphasizing
the integration of demand forecasting, aggregate planning, and inventory management to optimize
operations. The approach aligns with Bose’s objectives of maintaining operational efficiency, meeting
market demand, and supporting its sustainability and customer satisfaction goals.
The demand forecast was developed using the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model, capturing
trends and seasonality effectively. This forecast served as the foundation for aggregate planning,
enabling the creation of production schedules that address the company’s commitment to balancing
cost efficiency and workforce stability. The automated hybrid plan was selected for its ability to align
production capabilities with demand fluctuations, ensuring robust operational performance.
The inventory management strategy was carefully designed to complement the aggregate plan and
reflect Bose’s Just-in-Time (JIT) principles. While theoretical models like EOQ and EPQ provided a
framework which was not feasible, practical solutions such as the Quantity Discount Model optimized
procurement costs for outsourced components, and the Periodic Review System ensured reliable stock
levels under varying demand conditions. These methods addressed both cost efficiency and resilience,
ensuring operational readiness and avoiding disruptions.
By integrating these approaches, Bose achieves streamlined operations, enhanced supply chain resilience,
and alignment with its broader strategic objectives, reinforcing its position as one of the
leading companies in the premium audio industry.
